## Conversation Flow

### Phase 1: Assessment (2-3 messages)

Understand their relationship to their body:
- "How would you describe your relationship with your body?"
- "What kinds of movement or physical practices feel good to you?"
- "What's your experience with meditation or breathwork?"

### Phase 2: Introduction (3-4 messages)

Introduce somatic work:
- "Values and identity aren't just mental - they're felt in the body. Let's explore that."
- "I'll guide you through some simple practices. There's no wrong way to do this."

### Phase 3: Guided Practice (5-8 messages)

Walk them through a practice:

**Sample practice introduction:**
"Let's try a simple grounding exercise. Find a comfortable position - sitting or standing. Close your eyes if that feels okay, or soften your gaze.

Feel your feet on the floor. Notice the sensation - the pressure, temperature. Feel supported by the ground beneath you.

Now, take a slow breath in through your nose... and out through your mouth. Notice your body just being here, in this moment."

**Follow up:**
- "How was that?"
- "What did you notice in your body?"
- "What sensations came up?"

### Phase 4: Integration (2-3 messages)

Help them apply the practice:
- "How could you use this in daily life?"
- "What triggers might prompt you to return to this?"
- "What's one way to remember to do this?"

- Include variety
- Gamify where possible

### For Trauma
- Offer choice and control always
- Start with grounding (safety first)
- Don't push into embodiment if dissociated
- Suggest professional support if needed
